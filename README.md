# crowdsourcing-ml-models
Compares machine learning model performance on gold-standard dataset versus two machine learning models on crowd-sourced dataset, using Python sklearn.

This was a two-person group project where we had to assess the value of crowdsourced data labelling versus gold-standard (more expensive) datasets when training three supervised machine learning models. Our names are listed as authors on the specific Python files and sections we developed for the project.
The /data folder has two .csv files too large to upload to GitHub - gold_sample.csv, mturk_sample.csv. Refer to [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) for background information on this marketplace.

The PDF file reports explain the three decision-tree machine learning models and document their performance. The project has a number of parts:
- Preparation: data preparation, exploratory data analysis
- Part 1: training a decision tree machine learning model implementation on the gold-standard labelled dataset
- Part 2: machine learning model implementation on the crowd-sourced dataset and implementing majority voting
- Part 3: machine learning model implementation on the crowd-sourced dataset using David & Skene method
- Part 4: data description and results comparison reporting
