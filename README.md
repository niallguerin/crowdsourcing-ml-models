# crowdsourcing-ml-models
Compares machine learning model performance on gold-standard dataset versus two machine learning models on crowd-sourced dataset, using Python sklearn.

This was a two-person group project where we had to assess the value of crowdsourced data labelling versus gold-standard (more expensive) datasets when training three supervised machine learning models. Our names are listed as authors on the specific Python files and sections we developed for the project.

The PDF file reports explain the three decision-tree machine learning models and document their performance. The project has a number of parts:
- Preparation: data preparation, exploratory data analysis
- Part 1: training a decision tree machine learning model implementation on the gold-standard labelled dataset
- Part 2: machine learning model implementation on the crowd-sourced dataset and implementing majority voting
- Part 3: machine learning model implementation on the crowd-sourced dataset using David & Skene method
- Part 4: data description and results comparison reporting
